# Connecting a local file to git

Open the terminal, either on the VSCode or windows powershell.
Open the folder you wish to have your repo in. By folder, I mean cd into that folder. 
Copy the SSH of the repo from github and type the command 'git clone <SSH_copied>' and press enter.
Now cd into the folder that has been created inside the folder you were in.
To check, enter the command 'git remote -v'.
You will get an output like: 
  origin  git@github.com:USER-NAME/git_test.git (fetch)
  origin  git@github.com:USER-NAME/git_test.git (push)
This means that the repo is connected to your local machine.
