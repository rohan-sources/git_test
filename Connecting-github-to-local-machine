# Connecting a local file to git

Open the terminal, either on the VSCode or windows powershell.
Open the folder you wish to have your repo in. By folder, I mean cd into that folder. 
Copy the SSH of the repo from github and type the command 'git clone <SSH_copied>' and press enter.
Now cd into the folder that has been created inside the folder you were in.
To check, enter the command 'git remote -v'.
You will get an output like: 
  origin  git@github.com:USER-NAME/git_test.git (fetch)
  origin  git@github.com:USER-NAME/git_test.git (push)
This means that the repo is connected to your local machine.

Now, to start working, you need to add your file to the staging area. 
First, using the command 'git status' you can see that there are 'untracked files' meaning they are not in the stage nor committed rn.
Do the changes needed in your file and save it.
To add a file in the staging area, enter 'git add <file_name>'. Now, when you check status, you will see 'changes to be committed'.
After making all the necessary changes, to commit the file, enter 'git commit -m '<Description of the commit>
That makes the commit and you will see so in git status.

Do the same for all your files.
At the end, you can see all your commits using the command 'git log'.
After doing all the necessary changes, enter command 'git push'. This saves your changes to github.

Type git push. To be more specific, type git push origin main. 
Since you are not dealing with another branch (other than main) or a different remote (as mentioned above), you can leave it as git push.
